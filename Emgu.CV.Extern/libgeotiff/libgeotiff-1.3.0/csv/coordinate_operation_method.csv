Users are encouraged to use that document rather than the text which follows as reference because limitations in the transcription will be avoided.¶¶This method is utilised by some popular web mapping and visualisation applications. It applies standard Mercator (Spherical) formulas (method code 1026) to ellipsoidal coordinates and the sphere radius is taken to be the semi-major axis of the ellipsoid. This approach only approximates to the more rigorous application of ellipsoidal formulas to ellipsoidal coordinates (as given in EPSG dataset coordinate operation method codes 9804 and 9805).  Unlike either the spherical or ellipsoidal Mercator projection methods, this method is not conformal: scale factor varies as a function of azimuth, which creates angular distortion. Despite angular distortion there is no convergence in the meridian. ¶¶The formulas to derive projected Easting and Northing coordinates from ellipsoidal latitude (lat) and longitude (lon) first derive the radius of the sphere (R) from:¶	R = a¶¶Then applying spherical Mercator formulae:¶¶	E = FE + R(lon - lonO)              ¶	N = FN + R ln[tan(pi/4 + lat/2)]                   ¶where FE and FN are false easting and false nothing at the projection origin, other symbols are as listed above and logarithms are natural.¶¶If latitude lat = 90º, N is infinite. The above formula for N will fail near to the pole, and should not be used poleward of 88º.¶¶The reverse formulas to derive latitude and longitude on the sphere from E and N values are:¶	D = -(N-FN)/R = (FN-N)/R¶	lat = pi/2 - 2 atan(e^D) where e=base of natural logarithms, 2.7182818...¶	lon = [(E - FE)/R] + lonO¶¶¶If q_alpha is the scale factor at a given azimuth alpha, it is a function of R', the radius of curvature at that azimuth derived from:¶	R' = rho nu / (nu cos^2alpha + rho sin^2alpha)¶	q_alpha = R / (R' cos lat)¶where rho and nu are the radii of curvature of the ellipsoid at latitude lat in the plane of the meridian and perpendicular to the meridian respectively;¶rho = a(1 - e^2)/(1 - e^2 sin^2(lat))^3/2¶nu = a /(1 - e^2 sin^2(lat))^1/2¶¶Then when the azimuth is 0º, 180º, 90º or 270º the scale factors in the meridian (h) and on the parallel (k) are:¶	q_0 = q_180  = h = R / (rho cos(lat))¶	q_90 = q_270 = k = R / (nu cos(lat))¶which demonstrates the non-conformallity of the Pseudo Mercator method.¶¶Maximum angular distortion omega is a function of latitude and is found from:¶	omega = 2 asin{[ABS(h - k)] / (h + k)}","For Projected Coordinate Reference System: WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator¶¶Parameters:¶Ellipsoid:	WGS 84	a = 6378137.0 metres		1/f = 298.2572236¶			¶Latitude of natural origin (latO) = 0°00'00.000""N = 0.0 rad¶Longitude of natural origin (lonO) = 0°00'00.000""E = 0.0 rad¶False easting (FE) = 0.00 metres	¶False northing (FN) = 0.00 metres	¶¶Forward calculation for the same coordinate values as used for the Mercator (1SP) (Spherical) example (method code 9841): ¶Latitude (lat) = 24°22'54.433""N	= 0.425542460 rad¶Longitude (lon) = 100°20'00.000""W = -1.751147016 rad¶¶	R  = 6378137.0¶whence ¶	E = -11 169 055.58 m¶	N =   2 800 000.00 m¶and ¶	h  = 1.1034264¶	k  = 1.0972914¶	omega = 0°19'10.01""¶¶¶Reverse calculation for a point 10km north on the grid (-11 169 055.58 m E, 2 810 000.00m N) first gives:¶	D = -0.44056752¶¶Then	Latitude (lat) = 0.426970023 rad = 24°27'48.889""N¶	Longitude (lon) = -1.751147016 rad = 100°20'00.000""W",Applies spherical formulas to the ellipsoid.

The associated convention is known as the ""Coordinate Frame Rotation"" convention (EPSG coordinate operation method code 9607). ¶The formula is:¶¶   (X)             (  1      +Rz      -Ry)     (X)      (dX)¶   (Y)  =  M *  ( -Rz       1      +Rx)  * (Y)  +  (dY)¶   (Z)              ( +Ry   -Rx        1 )     (Z)       (dZ)¶¶and the parameters are defined as:¶¶(dX, dY, dZ)   : Translation vector, to be added to the point's position vector in the source coordinate reference system in order to transform from source coordinate reference system to target coordinate reference system; also: the coordinates of the origin of source coordinate reference system in the target frame.¶¶(Rx, Ry, Rz)   : Rotations to be applied to the coordinate reference frame.  The sign convention is such that a positive rotation of the frame about an axis is defined as a clockwise rotation of the coordinate reference frame when viewed from the origin of the Cartesian coordinate reference system in the positive direction of that axis, that is a positive rotation about the Z-axis only from source coordinate reference system to target coordinate reference system will result in a smaller longitude value for the point in the target coordinate reference system. Although rotation angles may be quoted in any angular unit of measure, the formula as given here requires the angles to be provided in radians.¶¶M                  : The scale factor to be applied to the position vector in the source coordinate reference system  in order to obtain the correct scale of the target coordinate reference system. M = (1+dS*10^-6), where dS is the scale correction expressed in parts per million.¶¶In the absence of rotations the two formulas are identical; the difference is solely in the rotations. The name of the second method reflects this.¶¶Note that the same rotation that is defined as positive in the first method is consequently negative in the second and vice versa.  It is therefore crucial that the convention underlying the definition of the rotation parameters is clearly understood and is communicated when exchanging datum transformation parameters, so that the parameters may be associated with the correct coordinate transformation method (algorithm).","The same example as for the Position Vector Transformation (coordinate operation method 9606) can be calculated, however the following transformation parameters have to be applied to achieve the same input and output in terms of coordinate values:¶¶Transformation parameters Coordinate Frame Rotation convention:¶dX (m) = 0.000 ¶dY (m) = 0.000 ¶dZ (m) = +4.5 ¶RX ("") = 0.000¶RY ("") = 0.000¶RZ ("") = -0.554 = -0.000002685868 radians¶Scale (ppm) = +0.219¶¶Please note that only the rotation has changed sign as compared to the Position Vector Transformation.",Note the analogy with the Position Vector transformation (code 9606) but beware of the differences!

It uses a gridded data set with nodes in a temporary projected CRS (ETRS89 / National Grid) for bi-linear interpolation of grid coordinate differences.¶¶The offsets at a point are derived by interpolation within the gridded data. One grid file contains both easting and northing offsets. The grid file format is given in documentation available from the information source. The coordinate reference system for the coordinates of the grid fiule nodes is an intermediary projected CRS, ETRS89 / British National Grid.¶¶For the transformation of ETRS89 coordinates to OSGB36 / British National Grid coordinates, the ETRS89 latitude and longitude are first converted into ETRS89 / National Grid values using the Transverse Mercator formulas given in EPSG method code 9807. Then bi-linear interpolation is used to derive easting and northing offset values. These are added to the temporary ETRS89 / National Grid coordinate values to give OSGB36 / National Grid coordinate values.¶¶For the transformation of OSGB36 / British National Grid coordinates to ETRS89 latitude and longitude, iteration is required. For the first iteration the OSGB36 / British National Grid easting and northing values are assumed to be in the ETRS89 / National Grid. Bi-linear interpolation is used to derive the easting and northing offset values which are applied with sign reversed to the input coordinates.The result is used in further iterations of interpolation and application of offset until the difference between results from successive iterations is insignificant.

The geoid model should be available as a regular grid of latitude and longitude with the height of the geoid above the ellipsoid at each grid node. Only the height is affected by this transformation; the geodetic latitude and longitude are not.¶¶The transformation involves the following sequence of steps:¶·  Selection of a subset of the geoid file covering the extent of the points to be transformed.¶·  If the geoid file is not based on the source or target CRS, it needs to be transformed first. This involves transformation of the chosen subset of the geoid file from its orignal Geographic 3D CRS to the Geographic 3D CRS that is the source or the target of this transformation.¶·  Calculation of the height of the geoid above the ellipsoid (""geoid undulation"") at the relevant point(s).

Users are encouraged to use that document rather than the text which follows as reference because limitations in the transcription will be avoided.¶¶To eliminate high correlation between the translations and rotations in the derivation of parameter values for the Helmert transformation methods (coordinate operation method codes 9606 and 9607), instead of the rotations being derived about the geocentric coordinate reference system origin they may be derived at a location within the points used in the determination. Three additional parameters, the coordinates of the rotation point, are then required. The formula is:¶¶   (Xt)             (  1       +Rz    -Ry)      (Xs - Xp)      (Xp)       (dX)¶   (Yt)  =  M *  ( -Rz      1      +Rx)  *  (Ys - Yp)  +  (Yp)  +  (dY)¶   (Zt)              ( +Ry   -Rx       1 )      (Zs - Zp)      (Zp)       (dZ)¶¶and the parameters are defined as:¶¶(dX, dY, dZ)   : Translation vector, to be added to the point's position vector in the source coordinate system in order to transform from source coordinate reference system to target coordinate reference system; also: the coordinates of the origin of source coordinate reference system in the target frame.¶¶(Rx, Ry, Rz)   : Rotations to be applied to the coordinate reference frame.  The sign convention is such that a positive rotation of the frame about an axis is defined as a clockwise rotation of the coordinate reference frame when viewed from the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system in the positive direction of that axis, that is a positive rotation about the Z-axis only from source coordinate reference system to target coordinate reference system will result in a smaller longitude value for the point in the target coordinate reference system. Although rotation angles may be quoted in any angular unit of measure, the formula as given here requires the angles to be provided in radians.¶¶(Xp, Yp, Zp)   : Coordinates of the point about which the coordinate reference frame is rotated, given in the source Cartesian coordinate reference system. ¶¶M                  : The scale factor to be applied to the position vector in the source coordinate reference system  in order to obtain the correct scale of the target coordinate reference system. M = (1+dS*10^-6), where dS is the scale correction expressed in parts per million.¶¶Reversibility.¶The Molodensky-Badekas transformation in a strict mathematical sense is not reversible, i.e. in principle the same parameter values cannot be used to execute the reverse transformation. This is because the evaluation point coordinates are in the forward direction source coordinate reference system and the rotations have been derived about this point. They should not be applied about the point having the same coordinate values in the target coordinate reference system, as is required for the reverse transformation. However, in practical application there are exceptions when applied to the approximation of small differences between the geometry of a set of points in two different coordinate reference systems. The typical vector difference in coordinate values is in the order of 6*10^1 to 6*10^2 metres, whereas the evaluation point on or near the surface of the earth is 6.3*10^6 metres from the origin of the coordinate systems at the Earths centre. This difference of four or five orders of magnitude allows the transformation in practice to be considered reversible. Note that in the reverse transformation, only the signs of the translations and rotation parameter values are reversed; the coordinates of the evaluation point remain unchanged.","Input point: ¶Coordinate reference system: La Canoa (geographic 2D)¶  Latitude =     9 deg 35 min 00.386 sec N¶  Longitude = 66 deg 04 min 48.091 sec W¶This is taken to be geographic 3D with an assumed Ellipsoidal height hS  =  201.465 m¶¶This transforms to Cartesian geocentric coords:¶   XS =  2 550 408.965 m¶   YS = -5 749 912.266 m¶   ZS =   1 054 891.114 m¶¶Transformation parameters La Canoa to REGVEN:¶   dX  = -270.933 m¶   dY  = +115.599 m¶   dZ  = -360.226 m¶   RX   = -5.266 sec = -0.000025530288 radians¶   RY  = -1.238 sec = -0.000006001993 radians¶   RZ  = +2.381 sec =  0.000011543414 radians¶   dS   = -5.109 ppm¶   Ordinate 1 of evaluation point  = 2464351.59 m¶   Ordinate 2 of evaluation point = -5783466.61 m¶   Ordinate 3 of evaluation point =    974809.81 m¶¶Application of the 10 parameter Molodenski-Badekas Transformation results in REGVEN geocentric coordinates of:¶   XT =  2 550 138.467 m¶   YT = -5 749 799.862 m¶   ZT  =  1 054 530.826 m¶¶This converts into:¶   Latitude =       9 deg 34 min 49.001 sec N¶   Longitude =  66 deg 04 min 54.705 sec W¶   Ellipsoidal height =  -18.10 m¶on the REGVEN geographic 3D coordinate reference system.¶¶Because the source coordinate reference system was 2D, the target system ellipsoidal height is ignored and the results treated as a geographic 2D coordinate reference system:¶   Latitude =       9 deg 34 min 49.001 sec N¶   Longitude =  66 deg 04 min 54.705 sec W",The [7-parameter] Coordinate Frame rotation method (code 9607) is a specific case of the Molodenski-Badekas 10-parameter transformation in which the evaluation point is the origin of the geocentric coordinate system at which coordinate values are zero.,"EPSG guidance note #7-2, http://www.epsg.org",OGP,2004-03-17,2002.510 2004.470,0

A 3-dimensional geographic coordinate reference system comprising of geodetic latitude, geodetic longitude and ellipsoidal height is converted to its 2-dimensional subset by the simple expedient of dropping the height.¶¶The reverse conversion, from 2D to 3D, is indeterminate. It is however a requirement when a geographic 2D coordinate reference system is to be transformed using a geocentric method which is 3-dimensional. In practice an artificial ellipsoidal height is created and appended to the geographic 2D coordinate reference system to create a geographic 3D coordinate reference system referenced to the same geodetic datum. The assumed ellipsoidal height is usually either set to the gravity-related height of a position in a compound coordinate reference system, or set to zero. As long as the height chosen is within a few kilometres of sea level, no error will be induced into the horizontal position resulting from the later geocentric transformation; the vertical coordinate will however be meaningless.",(none),This is a parameter-less conversion.,"EPSG guidance note #7-2, http://www.epsg.org",OGP,2004-04-27,,0

Note that the false northings of the origin, if the equator, will need to be large to avoid negative northings and for the UTM projection is in fact 10,000,000m. Alternatively, as in the case of Argentina's Transverse Mercator (Gauss-Kruger) zones, the origin is at the south pole with a northings of zero. However each zone central meridian takes a false easting of 500000m prefixed by an identifying zone number. This ensures that instead of points in ¶different zones having the same eastings, every point in the country, irrespective of its projection zone, will have a unique set of projected system coordinates. Strict application of the above formulas, with south latitudes negative, will result in the derivation of the correct Eastings and Northings. ¶¶Similarly, in applying the reverse formulas to determine a latitude south of the equator, a negative sign for lat results from a negative lat1 which in turn results from a negative M1.","For Projected Coordinate System OSGB 1936 / British National Grid¶¶Parameters:¶Ellipsoid  Airy 1830  a = 6377563.396 m  1/f = 299.32496¶then e'^2 = 0.00671534 and e^2 = 0.00667054¶¶Latitude Natural Origin         49°00'00""N   = 0.85521133 rad¶Longitude Natural Origin        2°00'00""W  = -0.03490659 rad¶Scale factor ko                     0.9996013                                                                                              False Eastings FE                 400000.00 m¶False Northings FN              -100000.00 m¶¶Forward calculation for: ¶Latitude       50°30'00.00""N  = 0.88139127 rad¶Longitude    00°30'00.00""E  = 0.00872665 rad¶A  = 0.02775415       C = 0.00271699¶T =  1.47160434       M = 5596050.46¶M0 = 5429228.60     nu  = 6390266.03¶¶Then Easting E =        577274.99 m¶          Northing N =       69740.50 m¶¶Reverse calculations for same easting and northing first gives :¶e1 =    0.00167322      mu1 = 0.87939562¶M1 = 5599036.80        nu1 = 6390275.88¶lat1  = 0.88185987      D = 0.02775243¶rho1 =6372980.21       C1 =  0.00271391¶T1 = 1.47441726¶¶Then Latitude       = 50°30'00.000""N¶         Longitude    = 00°30'00.000""E",,"EPSG guidance note #7-2, http://www.epsg.org",OGP,2007-02-19,2004.680 2007.029,0

The standard Transverse Mercator formulas (coordinate operation method code 9807) need to be modified to cope with this arrangement with¶¶Westing, W = FE - k0 nu[A + (1 - T + C)A^3/6 + (5 - 18*T + T^2 + 72*C - 58*e'^2)A^5/120]¶¶Southing, S = FN - k0{M - M0 + nu*tan(lat)*[A^2/2 + (5 - T + 9*C + 4*C^2)A^4/24 + (61 - 58*T + T^2 + 600*C - 330*e'^2)A^6/720]}¶¶In these formulas the terms FE and FN retain their definition, i.e. in the Transverse Mercator (South Orientated) method they increase the Westing and Southing value at the natural origin. In this method they are effectively false westing (FW) and false southing (FS) respectively.¶¶For the reverse formulas, those for the standard Transverse Mercator above apply, with the exception that:¶¶M1 = M0 - (S - FN)/k0¶and D = -(W - FE)/(nu1*k0), with nu1 = nu for lat1","See Transverse Mercator, code 9807, for general methodology.",,"EPSG guidance note #7-2, http://www.epsg.org",OGP,2002-07-31,2002.510,0

The reverse formulae to compute the geodetic coordinates from the grid coordinates involves computing the conformal values, then the isometric latitude and finally the geodetic values.¶¶The parameters of the conformal sphere and conformal latitude and longitude at the origin are computed as above. Then for any point with Stereographic grid coordinates (E,N) :¶¶chi = chi0 + 2 atan[{(N-FN)-(E-FE) tan (j/2)} / (2 R k0)]¶¶lambda = j + 2 i + lambda0¶¶where g = 2 R k0 tan(pi/4 - chi0/2)¶h = 4 R k0 tan(chi0) + g¶i = atan[(E-FE) / {h+(N-FN)}]¶j = atan[(E-FE) / (g-(N-FN)] - i¶¶Geodetic longitude lon = (lambda-lambda0 ) / n +  lambda0¶¶Isometric latitude psi = 0.5 ln [(1+ sin(chi)) / { c (1-  sin(chi))}] / n¶¶First approximation lat1 = 2 atan(e^psi)  - pi/2  where e=base of natural logarithms.¶¶psii = isometric latitude at lati¶¶where psii= ln[{tan(lati/2 + pi/4}  {(1-e sin(lati))/(1+e sin(lati))}^(e/2)]¶ ¶Then iterate lat(i+1) = lati - ( psii - psi ) cos(lati) (1 -e^2 sin^2(lati)) / (1 - e^2)¶¶until the change in lat is sufficiently small.¶¶For Oblique Stereographic projections centred on points in the southern hemisphere,  the signs of E, N, lon0, lon,  must be reversed to be used in the equations and lat will be negative anyway as a southerly latitude.¶¶An alternative approach is given by Snyder, where, instead of defining a single conformal sphere at the origin point, the conformal latitude at each point on the ellipsoid is computed.  The conformal longitude is then always equivalent to the geodetic longitude.  This approach is a valid alternative to the above, but gives slightly different results away from the origin point. It is therefore considered by EPSG to be a different coordinate operation method to that described above.","For Projected Coordinate System RD / Netherlands New¶¶Parameters:¶Ellipsoid   Bessel 1841    a = 6377397.155 m    1/f = 299.15281¶then e = 0.08169683¶¶Latitude Natural Origin      52°09'22.178""N  = 0.910296727 rad¶Longitude Natural Origin     5°23'15.500""E  =  0.094032038 rad¶Scale factor k0                 0.9999079¶False Eastings FE             155000.00 m¶False Northings FN           463000.00 m¶¶Forward calculation for: ¶¶Latitude    53°N = 0.925024504 rad¶Longitude   6°E = 0.104719755 rad¶¶first gives the conformal sphere constants:¶¶rho0 = 6374588.71    nu0 = 6390710.613¶R = 6382644.571    n = 1.000475857    c  = 1.007576465¶¶where S1 = 8.509582274  S2 = 0.878790173  w1 = 8.428769183¶sin chi0 = 0.787883237¶¶w   = 8.492629457   chi0 = 0.909684757      D0 = d0 ¶¶for the point  chi  = 0.924394997    D = 0.104724841¶¶hence B = 1.999870665    N = 557057.739    E = 196105.283¶¶reverse calculation for the same Easting and Northing first gives:¶¶g = 4379954.188    h = 37197327.96   i = 0.001102255   j = 0.008488122¶¶then  D = 0.10472467  Longitude = 0.104719584 rad =  6 deg E¶¶chi  = 0.924394767    psi = 1.089495123¶phi1 = 0.921804948       psi1 = 1.084170164¶phi2 = 0.925031162       psi2 = 1.089506925¶phi3 = 0.925024504       psi3 = 1.089495505¶phi4 = 0.925024504¶¶Then Latitude      = 53°00'00.000""N¶          Longitude   =   6°00'00.000""E","This is not the same as the projection method of the same name in USGS Professional Paper no. 1395, ""Map Projections - A Working Manual"" by John P.

Users are encouraged to use that document rather than the text which follows as reference because limitations in the transcription will be avoided.¶¶This grid is used as the basis for mineral leasing in Tunsia.  Lease areas are approximately 2 x 2 km or 400 hectares.  The corners of these blocks are defined through a six figure grid reference where the first three digits are an easting in kilometres and the last three digits are a northing.  The latitudes and longitudes for block corners at 2 km intervals are tabulated in a mining decree dated 1st January 1953.  From this tabulation in which geographical coordinates are given to 5 decimal places it can be seen that:¶a)  the minimum easting is 94 km, on which the longitude is 5.68989 grads east of Paris.¶b)  the maximum easting is 490 km, on which the longitude is 10.51515 grads east of Paris.¶c)  each 2 km grid easting interval equals 0.02437 grads.¶d)  the minimum northing is 40 km, on which the latitude is 33.39 grads.¶e)  the maximum northing is 860 km, on which the latitude is 41.6039 grads.¶f)  between 40 km N and 360 km N, each 2 km grid northing interval equals 0.02004 grads.¶g)  between 360 km N and 860 km N, each 2 km grid northing interval equals 0.02003 grads.¶¶Formulae are:¶¶Grads from Paris¶¶Lat (grads) = 36.5964 + [(N - 360) * A] ¶where N is in kilometres and A = 0.010015 if N > 360, else A = 0.01002.¶¶LonParis (grads) = 7.83445 + [(E - 270) * 0.012185], where E is in kilometres.¶¶The reverse formulae are:¶¶E (km) = 270 + [(LonParis - 7.83445) / 0.012185] where LonParis is in grads.¶¶N (km) = 360 + [(Lat - 36.5964) / B] ¶where Lat is in grads and B = 0.010015  if  lat>36.5964, else B = 0.01002.¶¶Degrees from Greenwich.¶¶Modern practice in Tunisia is to quote latitude and longitude in degrees with longitudes referenced to the Greenwich meridian.
